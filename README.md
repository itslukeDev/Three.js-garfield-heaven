## Info 🐈
This is just a basic and silly experiment to learn [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and other webdev tools (npm, parcel, ect). I mainly made this as a reference, test and a possible foundation for any silly projects I make with Three.js. 

[Click here for a live demo!](https://lukedev820.github.io/Three.js-basic-setup/)
## Installation 🐈
    git clone https://github.com/lukedev820/Three.js-basic-setup
    cd Three.js-basic-setup
    npm install
    npm run dev

## Configuration 🐈
- The threejs code can be found in `src/client.js` 
- Models should be placed in `static/`
## Contributions 🐈
I must admit I am still quite new to both Three.js and JavaScript. If you think i could have done something better or you believe a feature could improve the demo [(Dat GUI for example)](https://sbcode.net/threejs/dat-gui/) feel free to make a pull request!
